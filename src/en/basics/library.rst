Using the Library
=================

.. index:: ! from ... import

When programmer make use of a given function in different programs,
rather than redefining it in each program they write, they put them in
special programs called **libraries** and they have a way to ensure that
their other programs can use the functions that are found in the
library.

You are going to use the function ``turn_right()`` **a lot!** Instead of
rewriting it each time (remember Rule # 3), what you are going to do is
to write it **once** (more) but, this time, instead of writing it in the
editor with the **Python Code** tab, you will click on the **library** tab and
write it there. Oh, and you should also write ``turn_around()`` there as
well.

Then, when you want to use the functions defined in your library, you will
simply type ``from library import`` (followed by the function names, separated
by commas) on its own line in the Python Code editor.

.. topic:: Do this!

   After writing the functions ``turn_right()`` and ``turn_around()`` in
   the library, go back to the Python Code editor (so you no longer see your
   functions) and write a short
   program that nonetheless uses them to make sure that they work as
   expected. If they don't, go back and fix them.  Remember to use
   ``from library import turn_right, turn_around`` in your main program.

.. hint::

   With the appropriate functions defined in the library,
   here is such a program::

       from library import turn_right, turn_around
       move()
       turn_around()
       move()
       turn_right()
       move()
       turn_around()
       move()
       turn_left()  # back at starting position


From now on, whenever you define a function that you use more than once,
add it to your library so that you don't have to redefine it every time.


Reeborg can understand French
---------------------------------

There exists a special library which enables Reeborg to understand
French.  For example, instead of writing ``move()``, one can write ``avance()``
and Reeborg will do the right thing.  For example, try the following::

    from reeborg_fr import avance, tourne_a_gauche

    avance()
    tourne_a_gauche()

.. topic:: Your turn!

    Write a short program which uses the functions of the French library.

.. admonition:: For educators who prefer a language other than English

    A complete French version is available from the language menu at
    the top right. Other languages may be available as well, based
    on contributions from volunteers ... perhaps you'll be one of them
    and provide a translation in your own language! ;-)
