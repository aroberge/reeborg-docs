Summary
=======

It is now time to review what we have learned since the last Summary.

We have seen our first Python keywords, ``def``, ``from``, ``import``,
and how to save functions in a library to be used later.

We have seen the concept of looping, and a keyword unique
to Reeborg's World: ``repeat``.

We have seen five functions specific to Reeborg's World:

-  ``move()``
-  ``turn_left()``
-  ``take()``
-  ``put()``
-  ``pause()``

We are now ready to learn about some very important programming concepts
dealing with deciding automatically between different possibilities.
